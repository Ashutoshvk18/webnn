Introduction {#intro}
=====================

Introduction here.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## High-Level Use Cases ## {#usecases-highlevel}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for neural network
inference hardware acceleration. All applications in those use cases can be
built on top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models.

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user is browsing a social media site and wishes to take a photo and upload it
to the site. Before the photo is uploaded, the site does object detection (for
example, using object detection approaches such as [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] that use
a single DNN) to detect regions that include persons so that the user can filter
and de-personalize irrelevant persons on it.

### Skeleton Detection ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

The web application extracts her skeleton by running a machine learning model
which allows for real-time human pose estimation such as [[PoseNet]] to
recognize her gesture and body language. When she strikes a specified pose like
raising a hand, the web application automatically takes a photo and upload it to
an online storage.

### Random Image Generation ### {#usecase-image-generation}

A user wishes to make her new account and looks for a new icon image. When she
clicks a "Generate" button on the webpage for creating an account, the webpage
runs a generator model of generative adversarial network (GAN) for icon
synthesis [[LogoSynthesis]]. She can repeat random icon
generation until she finds her favorite one.

## Low-Level Use Cases ## {#usecases-lowlevel}

This section collects API-level use cases for a dedicated low-level API for
neural network inference hardware acceleration. It is expected that Machine
Learning frameworks will be key consumers of the Web Neural Network API (WebNN
API) and the low-level details exposed through the WebNN API are abstracted out
from typical web developers. However, it is also expected that web developers
with specific interest and competence in Machine Learning will want to interface
with the WebNN API directly instead of a higher-level ML framework.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebNN API. However,
she has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]],
etc. are not included in the WebNN API. So she constructs custom layers of the
additional activation functions on top of the WebNN API. Note that the scope of
custom layers may include convolution, normalization, etc. as well as
activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application developer is trying to implement a DNN model that refers to
outputs from some convolutional layer in [[MobileNets]] or [[ResNet]] as a
feature map. She wants to use a pre-trained model of these networks to reduce
training time. So she implements her network architecture so that its input is
the output of convolutional layers of pre-trained MobileNets or ResNet models.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that the model runs too slow on mobile devices
which does not have GPU acceleration. So her web application refers to the WebNN
API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so that the application
can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. So she modifies the application so that the application loads the tiny
model in the case of CPU-only devices.
