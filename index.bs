Introduction here.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## High-Level Use Cases ## {#usecases-highlevel}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for the Web Machine
Learning API (WebML API). All applications in those use cases can be built on
top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) models.

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user is browsing a social media site and wishes to take a photo and upload it
to the site. Before the photo is uploaded, the site runs [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] on
the WebML API to detect regions that include persons so that the user can filter
and de-personalize irrelevant persons on it.

### Skeleton Detecton ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

A user opens a web application that continuously captures her body with her
smartphone's camera. The web application extracts her skeleton by running
[[PoseNet]] on the WebML API to recognize her gesture or body language. When she
strikes a specified pose like raising a hand, the web application automatically
takes a photo and upload it to an online storage.

### Random Image Generation ### {#usecase-image-generation}

A user wishes to make her new account and looks for a new icon image. When she
clicks a "Generate" button on the webpage for creating an account, the webpage
runs a generator model of generative adversarial network (GAN) for icon
synthesis [[LogoSynthesis]] on the WebML API. She can repeat random icon
generation until she finds her favorite one.

## Low-Level Use Cases ## {#usecases-lowlevel}

This section collects API-level use cases for the WebML API. It is supposed that
ML frameworks refer to WebML API so that application developers can make use of
those capabilities via the frameworks.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebML. However, she
has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]], etc. are
not included in the WebML API. So she constructs custom layers of the additional
activation functions on top of the WebML API. Note that the scope of custom
layers may include convolution, normalization, etc. as well as activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application developer is trying to implement a DNN model that refers to
outputs from some convolutional layer in [[MobileNets]] or [[ResNet]] as a
feature map. She wants to use a pre-trained model of these networks to reduce
training time. So she implements her network architecture so that its input is
the output of convolutional layers of pre-trained MobileNets or ResNet models.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that the model runs too slow on mobile devices
which does not have GPU acceleration. So her web application refers to the WebML
API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so that the application
can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. So she modifies the application so that the application loads the tiny
model in the case of CPU-only devices.
